Start with the DataSet class and make it into a generic DataSetGen class.  This class should load any instance of a class that implements Measurable, and no classes that do not implement Measurable.  Test it with the DataSetTester.

The DataSetTester uses the BankAccount and BaseballPlayer classes.  Do not change any of the classes except DataSet.

Upload the original DataSet.java, DataSetTester.java, BankAccount.java, BaseballPlayer.java, and Measurable.java in a directory named GenericLab, into your repository in GitHub from Lab 1.  Upload DataSetGen.java into the same directory.
